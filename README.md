Large-number optimization: Methodology, algorithms and software

**Large-number Optimization** is a mathematical programming framework focused on *exact* arithmetic with integers and rational numbers of arbitrary size. Designed for optimization problems where exactness is needed and precision cannot be compromised, it leverages arbitrary-precision arithmetic to handle numerics well beyond traditional 64-bit or floating-point limitations. 

This project treats memory — not bit width — as the sole constraint. It aims to provide reliable tools for solving integer and fractional optimization problems without approximation errors and no worries about scaling, numerical rounding and stability.

## Core Objectives

- Support for exact arithmetic on integers and fractions of arbitrary length
- Tools for integer, linear, and mixed-integer programming with guaranteed precision 'exact'
- Optimizations that remain robust under extreme numerical scales
